# My Homepage

## Description

My goal for this project was to create my personal homepage using bootstrap to make it responsive. I used bootstrap to grab a nav for all of my html headers. I also used a bootstrap form to put into my contact.html and added a submit button at the bottom of the form. I used the bootstrap grid system to make my system responsive. I went about breaking it down into 3 rows with my header, content area, and footer being the 3 rows in each of my htmls.

## Best Features

I enjoy adding in my own touches and love putting in those "under the radar" features that can really separate me from the rest and truly make it my own. Some of those features are adding a hover affect on my portfolio page with a box shadow and a transition with a 1.1 scale increase when moused over. I also added a hover affect in the header for the links to my pages. Also in those links based on the page they are on there is an active feature that boldens the link and changes the color so it is easy to see which link they are currently on.

## Biggest Issues

The most difficult thing was just wrapping my head around how I go from a blank slate to where I get what I want. I was able to help over come this by focusing on one aspect first. I worked from the top down and my first goal was to get a clean and responsive header that I was happy with. Once I got there I celebrated that small victory! Then my next issue arose. I had trouble with creating the content within the page to look how I wanted. After a good bit of trail and error I was able to use a combo between the bootstrap and adding in my own css I got to the point that I was very pleased with.
